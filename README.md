# Flink Categorization

## Project Introduction

The **Flink Categorization** project is designed to categorize data streams using Apache Flink. This project leverages the powerful stream processing capabilities of Flink to process, analyze, and categorize large volumes of data in real-time. It is suitable for applications that require real-time data analytics, such as monitoring systems, recommendation engines, and more.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- **Apache Flink**: Version 1.14.0 or higher
- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher
- **Maven**: For building the project
- **Any other specific libraries or tools used in the project**

You can install these dependencies using the following commands:

```sh
# Install Apache Flink
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/flink/flink-1.14.0/flink-1.14.0-bin-scala_2.11.tgz
tar -xzf flink-1.14.0-bin-scala_2.11.tgz
cd flink-1.14.0

# Install Maven
sudo apt-get install maven

# Verify Java installation
java -version
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

This will compile the code and package it into a JAR file.

## Testing

To run tests for the project, use the following command:

```sh
mvn test
```

This will execute all the test cases defined in the project and provide a summary of the results.

## Executing the Code

To execute the code, you need to submit the JAR file to a Flink cluster. Use the following command to submit the job:

```sh
/path/to/flink/bin/flink run -c com.example.Main /path/to/your-jar-file.jar
```

Replace `/path/to/flink` with the actual path to your Flink installation and `/path/to/your-jar-file.jar` with the path to the JAR file generated by the build process.

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
